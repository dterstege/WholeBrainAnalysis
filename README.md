# IEGNetworkAnalyses

## WholeBrainAnalysis.m

*WholebrainAnalysis.m* was developed for the compilation and analysis of datasets collected using the Whole Brain software suite developed by Daniel FÃ¼rth (https://www.wholebrainsoftware.org) and incorporates a modification using scripts and plugins developed by Dylan Terstege (https://github.com/dterstege/CavalieriPointMask).

Whole Brain is a neuroanatomical information system. Neuroanatomical data obtained from microscope images is encoded and stored in stereotactic coordinate form within the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. The software suite can be accessed [here](https://www.wholebrainsoftware.com).

WholeBrainAnalysis.m was created by Dylan Terstege, a Neuroscience PhD candidate in the Epp Lab at the University of Calgary.
